# Nautobot SSoT ACI - Nautobot plugin for synchronizing with Cisco ACI
 
Nautobot SSoT ACI is a plugin for [Nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot) allowing a synchronization of data from Cisco ACI into Nautobot.

To accomplish this, the SSoT ACI plugin communicates with the Cisco ACI controller, the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC). The APIC provides a central point of administration for the ACI fabric via a web dashboard or REST API.

The SSoT ACI plugin eliminates the need for manually adding objects to Nautobot that have been automatically discovered by the Cisco APIC controller.   This includes information such as device model/serial numbers, node management IP addressing, and more.

In addition any changes to the ACI fabric are reflected in Nautobot when the synchronization process is executed. 

Examples:

- When new devices are registered to the fabric, they will be added to Nautobot on the next run of the SSoT ACI job within Nautobot.
- When devices are decommissioned from the fabric, they will be removed from Nautobot 
- As devices are added to the ACI fabric, their management IP addresses are automatically created as IP Addresses in Nautobot
- As bridge domains are added with subnets, the subnets are automatically created in Nautobot as Prefixes and the gateway address configured as an IP Address
- When a bridge domain is removed from ACI, the associated Prefix and IP Address are deleted from Nautobot
- Interface descriptions added or updated in ACI will be reflected on the interfaces in Nautobot

Below list shows items that are currently synchronized and how they map between systems.

## Installation and Configuration

The plugin is available as a Python package in pypi and can be installed with pip

```shell
pip install nautobot-ssot-aci
```

> The plugin is compatible with Nautobot 1.2.0 and higher

To ensure Nautobot SSoT for Cisco ACI is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `nautobot-ssot-aci` package:

```no-highlight
# echo nautobot-ssot-aci >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your `nautobot_config.py`

```python
# In your nautobot_config.py
PLUGINS = ["nautobot_ssot_aci"]
```

In addition, the plugin behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings.

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "nautobot_ssot": {
        "hide_example_jobs": True,
    },
    "nautobot_ssot_aci": {
        # URL and credentials should be configured as environment variables on the host system
        "apics": {x: os.environ[x] for x in os.environ if "APIC" in x},
        # Tag which will be created and applied to all synchronized objects.
        "tag": "ACI",
        "tag_color": "0047AB",
        # Tags indicating state applied to synchronized interfaces.
        "tag_up": "UP",
        "tag_up_color": "008000",
        "tag_down": "DOWN",
        "tag_down_color": "FF3333",
        # Manufacturer name. Specify existing, or a new one with this name will be created.
        "manufacturer_name": "Cisco",
        # Exclude any tenants you would not like to bring over from ACI.
        "ignore_tenants": ["common", "mgmt", "infra"],
        # The below value will appear in the Comments field on objects created in Nautobot
        "comments": "Created by ACI SSoT Plugin",
    }
```

Some of the above settings can be omitted, and if omitted the below defaults will take effect:
```python
default_settings = {"tag": "ACI",
                   "tag_color": "FF3333",
                   "manufacturer_name": "Cisco",
                   }                    
```

The APIC URL and credentials should be created as environment variables on the host system. Itâ€™s important to know that multiple APIC instances can be configured for synchronization and this is achieved by using an identifier at the end of the environment variable. In the example below this APIC will be called `NTC` however you can easily do something like `CHCG01` to identify an APIC instance in your Chicago facility.

```bash
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_BASE_URI_NTC=https://aci.cloud.networktocode.com
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_USERNAME_NTC=admin
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_PASSWORD_NTC=not_so_secret_password
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_VERIFY_NTC=False
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_SITE_NTC="NTC ACI"
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_TENANT_PREFIX_NTC="NTC_ACI"
```

Each environment variable above contains the identifier `_NTC` at the end to serve as an identifier for the APIC. This can be any string of characters that you would like to use to identify the APIC in your environment. The identifier can be selected at run time from the SSoT dashboard when initiating a synchronization job:

![SSoT APIC Job Options Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6945229/162986635-fd537a5f-9fa1-4a82-95fa-af60fa07d6c2.png)

If additional APICs are required, their credentials can be added using a different identifier appended to the end of the environment variables.  The identifier will then be available to choose from when executing a synchronization job.  For example, to add another set of credentials for a different APIC with the identifier `DEVNET`:

```bash
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_BASE_URI_DEVNET=https://sandboxapicdc.cisco.com
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_USERNAME_DEVNET=admin
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_PASSWORD_DEVNET=not_so_secret_password
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_VERIFY_DEVNET=False
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_SITE_DEVNET="DevNet Sandbox"
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_TENANT_PREFIX_DEVNET="DevNet"
```
> A Site will be created in Nautobot with the name specified in the `NAUTOBOT_APIC_SITE` environment variable and resources created by the plugin will be assigned to this site. 

> Tenants imported from ACI will be prepended with the unique name specified by the corresponding `TENANT_PREFIX` variable. This uniquely identifies tenants which might have the same name, but belong to two different APIC clusters. 

> If using the [Docker Development Environment](#docker), the URL and credentials should be defined in `development/creds.env`.  See the example in `development\creds.example.env`.  

### Configuring Device Templates
In order to create a new Device Type in Nautobot that maps to a specific model of ACI leaf or spine switch, a `YAML` file needs to be provided for that model. This allows the SSoT plugin to create a Device Type, including an Interface Template that has the ports and transceiver types (ex. 10GE SFP+) as specified in the YAML file.  The files should be placed in `nautobot_ssot_aci/diffsync/device-types`, and should match the model name as it appears in the ACI  Fabric Membership area of the APIC dashboard.  For example,  given a Model name of `N9K-C9396PX` as shown below,  the YAML file should be named `N9K-C9396PX.yaml`.  

![APIC Fabric Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6945229/156404496-b3f570aa-fa6b-40bc-9cfc-dcaaff55f459.png)

There are already examples of YAML files for a few common switch models in `nautobot_ssot_aci/diffsync/device-types`,  and several additional can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/netbox-community/devicetype-library/tree/master/device-types/Cisco). 


## Usage
You use the plugin by navigating to **Plugins > Dashboard** in Nautobot.  Then click on **Cisco ACI Data Source**.
![Nautobot SSoT Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6945229/155611179-8d39b79b-8c35-4a74-a871-2ebbc36a2b94.png)
 
From the **Cisco ACI Data Source** page you can click **Sync Now** to begin a synchronization job and view the history of synchronization jobs.

![SSoT ACI Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6945229/155611423-ad0381f0-7877-491f-b5ac-fb725f9c8150.png)

After clicking **Sync Now**, you can select whether you would like to do a dry-run as well as schedule when you would like the job to run.  With a dry-run, you can see what information will be brought from ACI into Nautobot without actually performing the synchronization. The job can be run immediately, scheduled to run at a later date/time, or configured to run hourly, daily, or weekly at a specified date/time.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcomed and automatically built and tested against multiple version of Python and multiple version of Nautobot through TravisCI.

The project is packaged with a light development environment based on `docker-compose` to help with the local development of the project and to run the tests within TravisCI.

The project is following Network to Code software development guideline and is leveraging:

- Black, Pylint, Bandit and pydocstyle for Python linting and formatting.
- Django unit test to ensure the plugin is working properly.

### Development Environment

The development environment can be used in 2 ways. First, with a local poetry environment if you wish to develop outside of Docker with the caveat of using external services provided by Docker for PostgresQL and Redis. Second, all services are spun up using Docker and a local mount so you can develop locally, but Nautobot is spun up within the Docker container.

Below is a quick start guide if you're already familiar with the development environment provided, but if you're not familiar, please read the [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md).

#### Invoke

The [PyInvoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) library is used to provide some helper commands based on the environment.  There are a few configuration parameters which can be passed to PyInvoke to override the default configuration:

* `nautobot_ver`: the version of Nautobot to use as a base for any built docker containers (default: 1.1.4)
* `project_name`: the default docker compose project name (default: nautobot_ssot_aci)
* `python_ver`: the version of Python to use as a base for any built docker containers (default: 3.6)
* `local`: a boolean flag indicating if invoke tasks should be run on the host or inside the docker containers (default: False, commands will be run in docker containers)
* `compose_dir`: the full path to a directory containing the project compose files
* `compose_files`: a list of compose files applied in order (see [Multiple Compose files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files) for more information)

Using **PyInvoke** these configuration options can be overridden using [several methods](http://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/stable/concepts/configuration.html).  Perhaps the simplest is simply setting an environment variable `INVOKE_NAUTOBOT_SSOT_ACI_VARIABLE_NAME` where `VARIABLE_NAME` is the variable you are trying to override.  The only exception is `compose_files`, because it is a list it must be overridden in a yaml file.  There is an example `invoke.yml` (`invoke.example.yml`) in this directory which can be used as a starting point.

#### Local Poetry Development Environment

1. Copy `development/creds.example.env` to `development/creds.env` (This file will be ignored by Git and Docker)
2. Uncomment the `POSTGRES_HOST`, `REDIS_HOST`, and `NAUTOBOT_ROOT` variables in `development/creds.env`
3. Create an `invoke.yml` file with the following contents at the root of the repo (you can also `cp invoke.example.yml invoke.yml` and edit as necessary):

```yaml
---
nautobot_ssot_aci:
  local: true
  compose_files:
    - "docker-compose.requirements.yml"
```

3. Run the following commands:

```shell
poetry shell
poetry install --extras nautobot
export $(cat development/dev.env | xargs)
export $(cat development/creds.env | xargs) 
invoke start && sleep 5
nautobot-server migrate
```

> If you want to develop on the latest develop branch of Nautobot, run the following command: `poetry add --optional git+https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot@develop`. After the `@` symbol must match either a branch or a tag.

4. You can now run nautobot-server commands as you would from the [Nautobot documentation](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for example to start the development server:

```shell
nautobot-server runserver 0.0.0.0:8080 --insecure
```

Nautobot server can now be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

It is typically recommended to launch the Nautobot **runserver** command in a separate shell so you can keep developing and manage the webserver separately.

#### <a name="docker"></a>Docker Development Environment

This project is managed by [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and has a few requirements to setup your development environment:

1. Install Poetry, see the [Poetry Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for your operating system.
2. Install Docker, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

Once you have Poetry and Docker installed you can run the following commands to install all other development dependencies in an isolated python virtual environment:

```shell
poetry shell
poetry install
invoke start
```

Nautobot server can now be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

To either stop or destroy the development environment use the following options.

- **invoke stop** - Stop the containers, but keep all underlying systems intact
- **invoke destroy** - Stop and remove all containers, volumes, etc. (This results in data loss due to the volume being deleted)

### CLI Helper Commands

The project is coming with a CLI helper based on [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to help setup the development environment. The commands are listed below in 3 categories `dev environment`, `utility` and `testing`.

Each command can be executed with `invoke <command>`. Environment variables `INVOKE_NAUTOBOT_SSOT_ACI_PYTHON_VER` and `INVOKE_NAUTOBOT_SSOT_ACI_NAUTOBOT_VER` may be specified to override the default versions. Each command also has its own help `invoke <command> --help`

### Project Documentation

Project documentation is generated by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) from the documentation located in the docs folder.  You can configure [readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.io/) to point at this folder in your repo.  A container hosting the docs will be started using the invoke commands on [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001), as changes are saved the docs will be automatically reloaded.
