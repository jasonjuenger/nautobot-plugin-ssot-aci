## Installation and Configuration

The plugin is available as a Python package in pypi and can be installed with pip

```shell
pip install nautobot-ssot-aci
```

> The plugin is compatible with Nautobot 1.2.0 and higher

To ensure Nautobot SSoT for Cisco ACI is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `nautobot-ssot-aci` package:

```no-highlight
# echo nautobot-ssot-aci >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your `nautobot_config.py`

```python
# In your nautobot_config.py
PLUGINS = ["nautobot_ssot_aci"]
```

In addition, the plugin behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings.

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "nautobot_ssot": {
        "hide_example_jobs": True,
    },
    "nautobot_ssot_aci": {
        # URL and credentials should be configured as environment variables on the host system
        "apics": {x: os.environ[x] for x in os.environ if "APIC" in x},
        # Tag which will be created and applied to all synchronized objects.
        "tag": "ACI",
        "tag_color": "0047AB",
        # Tags indicating state applied to synchronized interfaces.
        "tag_up": "UP",
        "tag_up_color": "008000",
        "tag_down": "DOWN",
        "tag_down_color": "FF3333",
        # Manufacturer name. Specify existing, or a new one with this name will be created.
        "manufacturer_name": "Cisco",
        # Exclude any tenants you would not like to bring over from ACI.
        "ignore_tenants": ["common", "mgmt", "infra"],
        # The below value will appear in the Comments field on objects created in Nautobot
        "comments": "Created by ACI SSoT Plugin",
    }
```

Some of the above settings can be omitted, and if omitted the below defaults will take effect:
```python
default_settings = {"tag": "ACI",
                   "tag_color": "FF3333",
                   "manufacturer_name": "Cisco",
                   }                    
```

The APIC URL and credentials should be created as environment variables on the host system. Itâ€™s important to know that multiple APIC instances can be configured for synchronization and this is achieved by using an identifier at the end of the environment variable. In the example below this APIC will be called `NTC` however you can easily do something like `CHCG01` to identify an APIC instance in your Chicago facility.

```bash
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_BASE_URI_NTC=https://aci.cloud.networktocode.com
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_USERNAME_NTC=admin
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_PASSWORD_NTC=not_so_secret_password
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_VERIFY_NTC=False
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_SITE_NTC="NTC ACI"
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_TENANT_PREFIX_NTC="NTC_ACI"
```

Each environment variable above contains the identifier `_NTC` at the end to serve as an identifier for the APIC. This can be any string of characters that you would like to use to identify the APIC in your environment. The identifier can be selected at run time from the SSoT dashboard when initiating a synchronization job:

If additional APICs are required, their credentials can be added using a different identifier appended to the end of the environment variables.  The identifier will then be available to choose from when executing a synchronization job.  For example, to add another set of credentials for a different APIC with the identifier `DEVNET`:

```bash
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_BASE_URI_DEVNET=https://sandboxapicdc.cisco.com
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_USERNAME_DEVNET=admin
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_PASSWORD_DEVNET=not_so_secret_password
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_VERIFY_DEVNET=False
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_SITE_DEVNET="DevNet Sandbox"
export NAUTOBOT_APIC_TENANT_PREFIX_DEVNET="DevNet"
```
> A Site will be created in Nautobot with the name specified in the `NAUTOBOT_APIC_SITE` environment variable and resources created by the plugin will be assigned to this site. 

> Tenants imported from ACI will be prepended with the unique name specified by the corresponding `TENANT_PREFIX` variable. This uniquely identifies tenants which might have the same name, but belong to two different APIC clusters. 

> If using the [Docker Development Environment](#docker), the URL and credentials should be defined in `development/creds.env`.  See the example in `development\creds.example.env`.  

### Configuring Device Templates
In order to create a new Device Type in Nautobot that maps to a specific model of ACI leaf or spine switch, a `YAML` file needs to be provided for that model. This allows the SSoT plugin to create a Device Type, including an Interface Template that has the ports and transceiver types (ex. 10GE SFP+) as specified in the YAML file.  The files should be placed in `nautobot_ssot_aci/diffsync/device-types`, and should match the model name as it appears in the ACI  Fabric Membership area of the APIC dashboard.  For example,  given a Model name of `N9K-C9396PX` as shown below,  the YAML file should be named `N9K-C9396PX.yaml`.

There are already examples of YAML files for a few common switch models in `nautobot_ssot_aci/diffsync/device-types`,  and several additional can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/netbox-community/devicetype-library/tree/master/device-types/Cisco).
