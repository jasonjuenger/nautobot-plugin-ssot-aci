From the **Cisco ACI Data Source** page you can click **Sync Now** to begin a synchronization job and view the history of synchronization jobs.

After clicking **Sync Now**, you can select whether you would like to do a dry-run as well as schedule when you would like the job to run.  With a dry-run, you can see what information will be brought from ACI into Nautobot without actually performing the synchronization. The job can be run immediately, scheduled to run at a later date/time, or configured to run hourly, daily, or weekly at a specified date/time.

Once you click **Run Job Now**, you will see the logs as the job progresses. When synchronization completes, you can click the **SSoT Sync Details** button to view the changes, or proposed changes, to Nautobot records.
